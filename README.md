# Travel Experience Site

Hi! This is a project developed with the intention to pratice CSS and HTML.
The main goals here were to pratice the basics of HTML and CSS building this website.

Nice things that could be learned from this project:

-   Flexbox concepts
    -   We covered the basics of flexbox, like: flex-direction, justify-content and align-items
-   Media queries
    -   All the site is responsive for smartphones, tablets and desktops.
